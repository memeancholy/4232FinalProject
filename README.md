# 4232FinalProject
Final project for my ITCS 4232 class. Assets not owned by me are the asphalt textures, the gun noises, and any standard Unity assets. 

Known Issues/Quirks:

-Hitting 'Back' in the car selection menu will bring you back to the main menu.

-Sometimes collisions with other vehicles will launch the player vehicle either high above or far below the map.

-Occasionally AI vehicles will miss a waypoint and stop driving. No known fix other than tweaking waypoint locations and AI movement values.

-AI vehicles also will go backwards on a course if one goes to the car selection menu, then back to the main menu to repeat navigation.

-Opening the project in Unity for the first time causes an error for reasons unknown. Closing and reopening the project fixes this; I have zero clue how or why.
